# Iowa Liquor Sales
In order to boost liquor sales, we would have to analyze the data contained in the public Iowa Liquor Sales database in order to make well-supported recommendations for the upcoming campaigns. We were asked to recommend how to allocate a marketing budget throughout the state. Within the text document, you will find SQL queries based on certain questions. There is also an excel sheet with data visualizations used for my presentation. Based off the data from: https://data.iowa.gov/Sales-Distribution/Iowa-Liquor-Sales/m3tr-qhgy
